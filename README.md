# a weather bot.

a project in apis and databases using java.

this is an very old project put together while following along to the tutorial here: https://rubenlagus.github.io/TelegramBotsDocumentation/java-telegram-bot-tutorial.html

### FIXME
- if the database becomes inaccessible, the user gets stuck in a loop at the entry menu message...

### TODO
- go through the code and document, clean up and improve
- user interface needs improvement:
    - after the location is given once, that same location is reused, and no further options are given.
- see the above fixme's
