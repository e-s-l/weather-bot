# A Telegram Bot

## NOTE:

I've removed the databases from the commit (you'll need to create these with the
right names), as well as the bottoken (should allow the user to give their own).


Written in Java.

Based off of the tutoiral here:
https://rubenlagus.github.io/TelegramBotsDocumentation/java-telegram-bot-tutorial.html

## Functions:

Can toggle on echoing o messages, return some user info (needs to be expanded), or return the weather (temperature, windspeed) based off the user's location (if this isn't already known, it will use a keyboard button to prompt for it).

All very basic. 

## To Do:

/wx ought to be able to be parsed a location as argument...

Need to have a think about how to make it useful.
