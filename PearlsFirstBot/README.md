# A Telegram Bot

Written in Java.

Based off of the tutoiral here:
https://rubenlagus.github.io/TelegramBotsDocumentation/java-telegram-bot-tutorial.html

## Functions:

Can toggle on echoing o messages, return some user info (needs to be expanded), or return the weather (temperature, windspeed) based off the user's location (if this isn't already known, it will use a keyboard button to prompt for it).

All very basic. 

## To Do:

Need to have a think about how to make it useful. 

Need to deal with multi-user use-cases (can figure out how to test this...)
